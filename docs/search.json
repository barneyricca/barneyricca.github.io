    "text": "This example is really just so I can practice putting R chunks into my blog and making sure everything works as I expect it to. I might even remove this blog after I’m better at this.\nThe mythical “everyone” knows to run a correlation, and to look at a scatterplot, as part of your exploratory data analysis (EDA). Amost all of these correlations are Pearson correlations, which are great for linear relationships, but not so great for nonlinear relationships. However, a distance correlation can start to get at the nonlinear. Here’s an example.\n\nset.seed(20230324)\nrunif(n = 50,\n      min = 1,\n      max = 20) -> # Yes, I write my R code\n  x                #  backwards. Deal with it.\n1.7 * (x-10) ^ 2 -2 + rnorm(n = 50,\n                            mean = 0,\n                            sd = 2) ->\n  y\n\nQuadratics are perhaps the “simplest” nonlinear relationship.\n![](quadratic.jpg)\nYep, looks nonlinear.\nThe Pearson correlation, 0.0133489 , fails to indicate a relationship but the distance correlation (energy::dcor) 0.5180028 does indicate a relationship. Bootstrapped confidence intervals would show that there is significance in the distance correlation value.\nWow, that wasn’t bad; render this document, then render the website homepage, and it works! Of course, there is no thumbnail. I’ll have to figure out how to use the [image] tab to have the plot be the thumbnail. (I could, as a workaround, save the plot, and then insert the saved plot. However, that seems clunky and open to problems. That’s for another day.)"

    "title": "Inferring Markov Chains",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A while ago I had a problem that would likely be addressed if I could model the data with a kth-order Markov chain. Before jumping in, I looked to see what anyone else had done, and as often seems to be the case when I find a problem that I’m interested in, I found a paper with James Crutchfield as the second author that has a lot to say on the topic. (I’ve never met him, but Crutchfield seems to have rather nice insights into a wide range of problems.) The paper starts off “Statistical inference of models from small data samples is a vital tool in the understanding of natural systems. In many problems of interest data consists of a sequence of letters from a finite alphabet.” (Emphasis in the original.) This sounds just the thing for working with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data.\nAn aside: EMA data generally consists of a number of survey questions (usually individual questions taken from psychological scales, like questions about depression taken from the PHQ-9,) answered on a cell phone app one or more times per day for a number of days. For example, data collected by Heather Littleton and colleagues asked hurricane survivors about 25 questions every day for 6 weeks. These questions can be used to create psychological “states” for each round of data collection, either by looking at the full scales from which the data are collected, or by clustering the responses, or some other method. This results in a “finite alphabet” of states, which are great fodder for Markov chains.\nThe problem, then, is to use the data to infer the appropriate order of Markov chain and to estimate the entries in the matrix, hopefully including confidence intervals (or in this case, Bayesian posterior credible intervals,) on those estimates. It is at this point that the paper of Strelioff et al. (2007) comes into play. The authors use a Bayesian approach to determine both the order and entries of the Markov matrices. However, like many papers, the whole thing needs some unpacking to be easily moved beyond the demonstrations in the paper. So, I sat down to do just that."

    "title": "Why Nonlinear?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Before jumping into all sorts of method-y things, I should explain why I think that nonlinear methods are important.\nLinear, reductive methods have been very successful. (Without them, for instance, the computer on which I’m composing this blog probably wouldn’t exist!) However, linear works best for the nonliving world; in the living world, almost nothing is linear. (And for that matter, almost nothing is normally distributed or easily reduced to itself separate from its environment.) I believe that we teach linear because (a) it is less hard than nonlinear (in general) and (b) cultural inertia leads teachers to teach what they were taught, and linear got here first.\nBut we know that the linear doesn’t really work in real (living) life: 1 aspirin may be good, but 20 are not 20 times better. 1 chocolate milkshake may be wonderful, but 20 chocolate milkshakes are anything but 20 times as wonderful. Economists talk about “diminishing returns” (and if you’re Brian Arthur, “increasing returns”) which mean “not linear.” And there are an almost infinite number of other examples. Hence, the world appears to be is nonlinear.\nFor small changes, linear approximations to nonlinearities work well, though; a flat (linear) map of a city is fine for navigating, but a flat (linear) map of the world will not result in very efficient airline routes. Because of this, linear has had successes (and will continue to have successes) in social science research. But because few researchers consider what is “small” enough for the linear approximation to work, there are lots of seeming problems that arise with the linear paradigm.\nHence, we should move beyond the linear.\nOf course, we shouldn’t move too far beyond the linear:\n\n\n\n\n\n(The spacetime soccer comic is used with permission from XKCD)"

    "text": "I write. A lot. I write to take notes, but more importantly, I write because I think better when I’m writing than when I’m typing. However, over time I ended up with many notebooks but without a good way to index or organize them. So, I thought, I could try an electronic notebook. Which I did.\nSeveral times.\nMy first (in maybe 2018) was a not-ready-for-prime time device. That company is a few versions on from the one I tried, but I haven’t tried their recent offerings.\nI could, perhaps, try an iPad with the fancy pen. But that doesn’t work for me. I’m not opposed to Apple products - my house has at least 4 iPhones, 3 MacBooks, 3 airPods, 2 iPads, and 2 Apple watches - but I found that there were three problems with using an iPad. First, I could never get a combination of pen nib and screen protector that felt right for writing; they were always too slick. Plus, I had to put a piece of heat shrink tubing on the pen to get a grip I liked. (Fortunately, the iPad came courtesy of my previous employer, so I only had to pay for the modifications I made, all of which could be undone when I had to return the iPad when I left.) Second, it didn’t work well outside on a sunny day. (Hey, I have a chair swing in my backyard that is a good place for musing.) And third, my eyes are really dry and the iPad screen created a lot of eye strain. So, the iPad was out.\nThen I saw an ad for the Remarkable2 and took a chance. I really liked it. A lot. It felt good. It’s an eInk device - only greyscale - but that means it works well in the sunlight. Plus it had some neat features: Convert to PDF (with or without handwriting recognition), the ability to email notes directly from the device, the ability to work with PDF (including filling out forms!), screencasting (for drawing during the long e-meetings) and cloud storage. As I said, I liked it a lot. The biggest downsides were the limited memory (8 GB) and a proprietary operating system that meant I couldn’t put a Kindle app on it. (Say what you want about Amazon, but I have lots of technical ebooks, which means I have lots of Kindle books. I like real books better, but (a) I can’t take them with me when I travel and (b) our house has a ton of windows, so relatively little wall space for bookshelves.)\nBut then, one day, my social media feed thought I needed a Supernote. Hmm…let’s try it. Backlit (so I could read and write in the dark). It could play music through my bluetooth earbuds. More storage (64 GB vs 8 GB for the Remarkable2). It had the ability to put a Kindle reader on it (because it runs on Android OS). Technically, the Supernote is really well done (although the manual is a bit lacking). But the writing didn’t feel as good to me as the Remarkable2.\nThen there was the Onyx Boox Note Air 2. It was backlit. And it had more memory than the Remarkable2. And the writing feel was almost as good as the Remarkable2. (The difference is really small, but I can notice it if I pay attention.) And it could get a Kindle app (Android again). And, supposedly, later this year, there will be a Zotero app available for Android. (In the same way that my ebooks are basically all Kindle, or converted to Kindle using Calibre, I keep all my PDFs in Zotero.)\nThe Boox, because of the OS, also has other advantages, although these are more in the category of tiebreakers for me: Music, Outlook (so I can delete all the emails I don’t need to deal with), the NYT crossword app. (Sorry, games like Wordle don’t do well on greyscale.) And even a basic web-browser for when I absolutely need to get to Wikipedia.\nAnd so, my search ended. I use an Onyx Boox as my everyday device, and I really do like it. It has some deficiencies. Finding a decent case was non-trivial. (Hey, I dropped my Remarkable2 on a brick floor, but the case protected it, so I’m a big believer in cases.) The power button and the charging port are on the left hand side of the device, so I had to cut a hole in the case so that it could be charged while the case was closed. The Remarkable2 had a little bit easier transfer of files. The pen (and replacement nibs) is a bit expensive, but that’s okay because I use my Remarkable2 pen. (Speaking of pens, be sure to get one with the eraser; it is very handy.)\nNow, for my cheat on all this. I’m going to get rid of the Supernote, but I’m keeping the Remarkable2 in addition to the Onyx Boox. When I’m working my way through a textbook (so much to learn, so little time), the flipping back and forth from book to notes was really annoying me. (It would be nice if Onyx would install a flip back and forth feature, and let me copy and paste between apps. Of course, if they add enough more then the device will slow to a crawl and, well, then we’re back to having a laptop. Oh, well.) So, my Remarkable2 is getting use as a homework aid; I read the text on the Boox, and take notes and do homework problems on the Remarkable2."

    "text": "Welcome to my miscellaneous musings on methods for the study of nonlinear systems! This is a place for occasional writings about statistics and the even more occasional musings on other stuff. Three factors drive what shows up on these pages.\nFirst, I have an interest in modeling social science systems using nonlinear dynamical system methods and approaches. There are a lot of ins and outs when doing this work and this site will force me into being explicit and therefore a little bit more rigorous about my thoughts. That will be particularly useful (to me, at least!) while I’m trying to learn something or struggling to understand a paper. This site will also give me a place to put stuff which probably doesn’t deserve a paper but which should be public. Making something public enables others to benefit from it. Besides, someone might see something, comment on it, and improve my understanding. In the words of my dissertation adviser:\n“To engage in research, you must not hide anything you find. It is impossible to hoard research results or ideas because they are so immensely perishable that no refrigerator or freezer is capable of preserving them; ‘except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.’ On the contrary, you must be willing to feed what you produce into the meat grinder of your colleagues’ criticism where it can be transformed, matured and blended and finally bring forth much fruit.”\nThe second driver is that much of what I write here is being written so that I can learn it or learn to do it better in R. Some of this stuff is to help me prepare for presentations, and some is to integrate or juxtapose ideas in new ways just because that’s how I like learning. But whatever the details, I’m writing stuff so that I will understand it better. If it benefits others, then I’ll consider that to be a added benefit.\nThe third driver is that some things are just of interest to me, and I want to play around with them. The blog will serve as my notes.\nA note about complex dynamic systems (CDS) and nonlinear dynamic systems (NDS). When I first started doing this type of work there wasn’t a clear distinction between these two. However, the distinction between these two has become more clear in recent years. (See, for example, a recent (as of now!) piece by Maxi San Miguel on Complex Systems that largely separates CDS from the work that I do, particularly in terms of the datasets that I investigate.)"
